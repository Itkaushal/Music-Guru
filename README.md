## 💡 Architecture Overview

### **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** 🔄

- **Model**: Data layer that handles API requests (Retrofit) and manages data.
- **View**: UI layer (Activity/Fragment) that observes data changes and displays it to the user.
- **ViewModel**: The bridge between the View and the Model. It holds the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

### **LiveData** 🟢
  - Used to observe data from ViewModel and update the UI when the data changes (e.g., when new videos or songs are loaded).

### **Coroutines** ⏳
  - Handle background tasks asynchronously, ensuring the app remains smooth and responsive even during heavy network requests.

### **Retrofit** 🌐
  - Make network calls to the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch videos, songs, and other media-related data.
